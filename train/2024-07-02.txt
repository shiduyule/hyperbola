
When using an image dataset for supervised learning, itâ€™s essential to have appropriate labels for each image. Here are the primary formats for image labels:

Category Labels (Classification):

Integer Labels: Each category is represented by an integer (e.g., MNIST dataset labels digits from 0 to 9).
String Labels: Each category is represented by a string (e.g., CIFAR-10 dataset labels include "cat," "dog," "car," etc.).
One-Hot Encoding: Each category is represented by a vector with a length equal to the number of categories. For example, in a three-category problem ("cat," "dog," "car"), "cat" can be represented as [1, 0, 0].
Multi-Label Classification: Each image can have multiple labels, represented by multiple binary values or vectors.

Regression: Labels are continuous values, such as the size or age of an object in the image.

Segmentation: Labels are mask images the same size as the original image, with each pixel value representing a category.

Detection: Labels include bounding box coordinates and categories, such as (x, y, width, height).

File Formats for Labels
CSV File: Often used to store the correspondence between image filenames and labels. For example:

filename,label
img1.jpg,0
img2.jpg,1
img3.jpg,2
JSON File: Useful for complex label structures like multi-label or detection tasks. For example:

{"images": [{"filename": "img1.jpg", "label": 0}, {"filename": "img2.jpg", "label": 1}, {"filename": "img3.jpg", "label": [1, 0, 0]}]}
Directory Structure: For simple classification tasks, using directory names as labels. For example:

dataset/
cat/
img1.jpg
img2.jpg
dog/
img3.jpg
img4.jpg
Choose the label format that best suits the specific task and dataset requirements to ensure accurate and efficient representation of the target information in the images.
